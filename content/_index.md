      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-

        I currently focuse on high-dimensional hidden state models and nonparametric statistics. My work is situated at the intersection of advanced statistical methodologies and their practical applications within the fields of economics, energy, and climate.

        Utilizing a blend of cutting-edge statistical techniques, my aim is to dissect and understand complex data sets to unearth underlying patterns and dynamics. This analytical approach not only aids in enhancing our understanding of these critical sectors but also in crafting innovative solutions tailored to meet the specific challenges they present.

        Through my research, I strive to contribute to the development of robust models that can predict and influence future outcomes, helping to steer economic and environmental strategies towards sustainability and resilience. This mission is driven by a commitment to excellence in data analysis and a commitment to addressing some of the most pressing issues of our times.
