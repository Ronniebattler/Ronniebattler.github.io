# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The Fintech evolution has reshaped commercial banks in China, necessitating a study 	of its influence on their operational efficiency. Using data from 57 Chinese commercial banks 	between 2011 and 2020, operational efficiency was gauged via Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) 	and further decomposed with the Malmquist index method. A Generalized Moment Estimation 	model (GMM) assessed Fintech's impact on efficiency. Findings indicated that technological 	advancements primarily boost bank efficiency. While Fintech aids in enhancing efficiency, its 	assimilation varies across different bank types.
