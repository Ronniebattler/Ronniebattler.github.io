abstract: "This paper investigates the learning performance of the perceptron model based on 	Markov sampling, which builds upon the traditional framework with independent and identically 	distributed samples. Initial efforts establish the constraints on the perceptron model’s learning 	performance with uniformly ergodic Markov chain samples and validates its consistent behavior. 	Furthermore, this study introduces a ueMC-PM algorithm. Numerical investigations undertaken 	on benchmark repositories reveal that the perceptron model utilizing ueMC samples yields fewer 	misclassification rates."
